These discussions are where you can share suggestions for how the LEGACY Network, platform and products should be improved and discuss those improvements with other community members. Check out [Making suggestions](#making-suggestions) to learn how to provide feedback.

## Making Suggestions

We encourage you to [open a discussion](https://github.com/TheLegacyNetwork/community/discussions) if you have suggestions for how we can improve the LEGACY Network, platform and products. You don't need to have a solution to the problem you are facing to kick off a discussion. We hope to foster productive and collaborative conversations, so please check out [how to give good feedback](https://github.com/TheLegacyNetwork/community/discussions/2) for guidance on how to kick off a successful discussion.

Prior to creating a new discussion, please take a look at previous discussions to see if someone else has already shared your suggestion(s). If you find a similar discussion, reply with additional details or upvote the discussion to signal your support rather than creating a new one.

### From a suggestion to a shipped feature

Once you kick off a discussion, the LEGACY team will evaluate the feedback but will not be able to respond to every submission. From there, we will work with you, and the LEGACY community, to ensure we understand the current capabilities the LEGACY platform or product doesn‚Äôt have and explore the space for potential solutions to your problem statement:

- If the LEGACY community determines that we are going to prioritise a feature to solve the problem you've identified, we may open an issue and track its development in the [LEGACY specs repository roadmap](https://github.com/TheLegacyNetwork/specs/docs/roadmap/).
- If the LEGACY community determines that we will not be working to solve the problem you have identified, we may comment on the discussion describing our reasoning so our decisions can remain transparent.
